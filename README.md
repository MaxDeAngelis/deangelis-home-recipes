DeAngelisHome.com
======

DeAngelisHome is a side project web side starting when I attended UNH. The basic idea is that it is a recipe sharing site that is administrated by a common admin. This admin is required to approve new users and give them access to the site. 

Once given access a user can:

- Search recipes
- Create recipes
- Edit their own recipes
- Crop images for recipes
